## The second mission
- Duration: 3 days
- Create "The impossible quiz", completely with typescript.

ðŸŒ± Must-have's
- 10 pages, each with a question and an input field for an answer.
When wrong -> try again message | When right -> move to next page (next question).


ðŸŒ¼ Nice-to-have's (Doable)
- Use different types of answers (numbers, strings, arrays, etc).
- Add/remove lives for correct and wrong answers.
- Add a timer on all the questions. (time up = lose life)


ðŸŒ³ Nice-to-have's (hard)
- Create a user input at the start of the game to play with a username.
- Add animation to the pages.
- Create a hint-button per question: 1 hint costs 1 live.
